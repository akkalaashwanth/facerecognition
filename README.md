# Face Recognition with Siamese Network
This project implements a face recognition system using a Siamese Neural Network. The system is designed to verify whether two face images belong to the same person by calculating the distance between their embeddings.

The project is built using TensorFlow for the Siamese model, OpenCV for real-time webcam image capture, and Kivy for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Features
Real-Time Face Recognition: Capture face images in real-time using a webcam and verify their identity against stored reference images.
Siamese Neural Network: The model uses a custom layer (L1 distance) to compare embeddings from two images and verify if they match.
Graphical Interface: A simple GUI built using Kivy to facilitate the verification process.
TensorFlow Model: Uses a pre-trained or custom-built Keras model to perform face verification.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facerecognition.git
cd facerecognition
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Verify OpenCV Installation:

Install OpenCV using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Ensure TensorFlow is installed:

Install TensorFlow:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow
Kivy Installation: Install Kivy to create the GUI:

bash
Copy code
pip install kivy
Usage
Once the project is installed, you can run the face recognition app with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python faceid.py
Key Steps:
Input Face Image: The system captures a real-time face image from your webcam.
Face Verification: When the "Verify" button is pressed, the system compares the captured image against the stored verification images.
Verification Result: The result (verified/unverified) is displayed in the GUI.

Model Details
The Siamese network is built with the following architecture:

Embedding Layer: Extracts high-level features from the face images.
L1 Distance Layer: Custom layer (L1 distance) that computes the absolute difference between two embeddings.
Sigmoid Classifier: A Dense layer with sigmoid activation that outputs the probability of a match.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Black Screen in Kivy:

Ensure that your OpenCV is correctly capturing webcam feed. You can test this using a simple OpenCV script.
Verify that the webcam is not in use by another application.
Camera Not Detected:

Make sure the correct index is passed to cv2.VideoCapture(). Try changing the camera index from 0 to 1 or higher.
TensorFlow Model Issues:

Ensure that the model file (facerecg.h5) is in the correct location and that it is compatible with the current version of TensorFlow.
Kivy Dependencies:

Some users might face issues with Kivy installations on certain platforms. Ensure that all Kivy dependencies are properly installed.
